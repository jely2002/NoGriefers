# NoGriefing
Bukkit plugin - NoGriefing - 1.8.8 compiled

NoGriefing is an anti-grief plugin which is still under heavy development. The goal of this plugin is to keep it as simple as possible! With this plugin you can prevent people from breaking and placing blocks. You can also prevent people from dropping items.

Commands:

- /ng blockplace <true/false> (Disable or enables blockplace)
- /ng blockbreak <true/false> (Disable or enables blockbreak)
- /ng itemdrops <true/false> (Disable or enables itemdrops)
- /ng help (Shows the help menu)
- /ng sos (Activates emergency mode, everyone without OP cannot build, place or drop items)
- /ng reload (Reloads config)
- /ng version (Shows the version of the plugin)
Config:

In the configuration file you can change most of the messages. And you can manually enable / disable the anti-grief features. Click here to see the config!

Permissions:

- ng.placeblocks (Bypasses the anti block place feature)
- ng.breakblocks (Bypasses the anti block break feature)
- ng.dropitems (Bypasses the anti item drop feature)
OP's will get all of the permissions.

Note

If you have issues with the plugin you can report them here.

The plugin was first called: NoGriefers. I still have to change the logo and some code. I'm on my phone so I cant do that right now. Tomorrow I'll upload all renamed resources.

You can download the older 1.8 version here.
