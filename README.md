NoGriefing is an anti-grief plugin which is still under heavy development. The goal of this plugin is to keep it as simple as possible! With this plugin you can prevent people from breaking and placing blocks. You can also prevent people from dropping items. A new feature is the logging of blocks. You can specify what blocks you want the plugin to log. If that block is placed, the plugin will put the name of the player and the block that the player placed in the config file.

And of course you can disable TNT!

- /ng settings (Opens the plugin management GUI)
- /ng help (Shows the help menu)
